## Things I Love About You, Vishaal ❤️  

You make me more present. I find myself on my phone less and overthinking less when I’m with you. I still overthink our future sometimes, but overall, I feel so much more at ease.  

The way you look at me and touch me makes me feel so beautiful.  

I love how comfortable we are around each other we can be our weirdest, silliest selves.

You make me curious about things and I love learning with you.  

I feel like we make a great team as long as we stay patient and respect each other.  

Trying new things with you is easy and natural.  

You bring out both my childlike, carefree side and my nurturing side.  

You never make me feel crazy for wanting to plan details for trips or hangouts, and you’re so flexible when things change.  

I fall asleep so peacefully when I’m next to you. Even on nights I usually struggle with sleep, having you close makes everything better.  

You never make me feel self-conscious about myself.  

You’re committed to what you love, and I admire that so much.  

You’re always excited to share your interests with me, and I love seeing your passion.  

You always, always make me laugh.  

You’re so generous and never make me feel like I don’t do enough.  

You’re curious about life and people, and you always ask the best, most thought-provoking questions.  

You’re a problem solver and handle challenges so well.  

You have so much empathy for me, and I feel so safe with you.  

Even though you’re set in your ways, you’re always willing to try new things with me.  

You walk with me, not ahead of me, and that means more to me than you know.  

You appreciate me even for the smallest things I do.  

If something is important to me, you find a way to make it happen—even if it’s hard for you.  

You always, always make time for me. I never feel like I’m competing for your attention.  

You’re health-conscious and take care of yourself, and I love that about you.  

You’ve never been violent, angry, or disrespectful—with me or anyone else.  

You’re affectionate and consistent, whether we’re alone or in public.  

You’ve been so transparent about your past, and I respect that so much.  

You take accountability for your actions, and if you upset me, you always acknowledge it, say sorry, and actually try to improve.  

You prioritize quality time and always make me feel like my presence matters.  

You’re emotionally stable, even when things get tough, and you always focus on solving the problem instead of dwelling on it.  

You finish tasks quickly and don’t let things pile up (unlike me lol).  

You offer to carry my stuff without me asking and always open doors for me.  

You’re clean and organized with your things, and I appreciate that so much.  

You always remember to charge my devices.  

That night when I was falling asleep on the couch, you were so patient in trying to get me to go to bed. You weren’t frustrated—you just wanted me to sleep well. That was so sweet.  

You made me a PB sandwich without me asking, just because you thought I might get hungry before lifting.  

When I told you that we don’t do enough of my stuff, you actually listened and said you’d try harder—even told me you wanted to watch a Bollywood movie with me.  

You helped me plan my birthday trip so patiently.
